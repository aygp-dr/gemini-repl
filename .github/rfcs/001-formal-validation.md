# RFC: Formal Methods Tooling Validation

**RFC Number**: 001  
**Title**: Formal Methods Tooling Validation for Gemini REPL  
**Author**: @aygp-dr  
**Status**: Draft  
**Created**: 2025-07-13  
**Labels**: `rfc`, `formal-methods`, `validation`, `tooling`

## Summary

Establish a comprehensive validation framework for the TLA+ and Alloy specifications in the Gemini REPL project, ensuring formal specifications accurately model the system behavior before implementation and self-modification capabilities are added.

## Motivation

Before the Gemini REPL gains self-hosting capabilities (reading, modifying, and improving its own code), we must ensure:

1. Formal specifications correctly model intended behavior
2. TLA+ and Alloy tools are properly configured
3. Specifications can catch implementation errors
4. A validation pipeline exists for continuous verification

This validation framework will serve as the correctness foundation for the self-hosting features.
