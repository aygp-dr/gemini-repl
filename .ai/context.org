* Session Overview

Extensive development session on the Gemini REPL project, implementing UI enhancements and core functionality improvements.

* Timeline and Accomplishments

** Morning: Project Understanding
- Analyzed existing codebase structure
- Identified linting infrastructure needs
- Found issue #25 about adding ClojureScript and shell linting

** Mid-Session: Infrastructure Development
- Implemented comprehensive linting:
  - ClojureScript linting with clj-kondo
  - Shell script linting with shellcheck
  - Added ~gmake lint~ target
  - Fixed all shell script issues
- Set up testing infrastructure:
  - Created test directory structure
  - Added unit tests for core functions
  - Integrated tests into CI/CD

** Afternoon: UI Enhancements
*** Confidence Indicators (#36)
- Added visual confidence indicators based on avgLogprobs
- Three-tier system: ðŸŸ¢ (>95%), ðŸŸ¡ (>80%), ðŸ”´ (â‰¤80%)
- Integrated with metadata display
- Added comprehensive unit tests

*** Compact Metadata Display (#44)
- Fixed verbose multi-line metadata display
- Implemented single-line format: ~[ðŸŸ¢ 150 tokens | $0.0001 | 2.5s]~
- Removed visual clutter and separator lines
- 80% reduction in vertical space usage

** Evening: Core Functionality
*** Conversation Context (#47)
- Discovered critical bug: REPL was stateless
- Implemented conversation history tracking
- Added ~/context~ command
- Minimal implementation (~18 lines of code)
- Enables multi-turn dialogues

* Technical Decisions

** Architecture Choices
- Used atoms for state management (session-state, conversation-history)
- Maintained backward compatibility with string responses
- Kept changes minimal and focused

** Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for pure functions only
- No external API calls in tests
- Focus on confidence calculations and utility functions

** UI/UX Philosophy
- Less is more: compact displays
- Visual indicators for quick understanding
- Progressive disclosure of information

* Code Snippets

** Confidence Indicator Implementation
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn confidence-indicator [logprob]
  (when logprob
    (let [confidence (* 100 (js/Math.exp logprob))]
      (cond
        (> confidence 95) "ðŸŸ¢"
        (> confidence 80) "ðŸŸ¡"
        :else "ðŸ”´"))))
#+END_SRC

** Conversation Context
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defonce conversation-history (atom []))

;; In make-request:
(swap! conversation-history conj 
       #js {:role "user" 
            :parts #js [#js {:text prompt}]})
#+END_SRC

* Issues and Solutions

** Problem: No conversation context
- **Solution**: Added conversation-history atom
- **Impact**: Transformed REPL from stateless to stateful

** Problem: Verbose metadata display
- **Solution**: Single-line bracketed format
- **Impact**: Much cleaner, more readable output

** Problem: No confidence feedback
- **Solution**: Visual indicators based on logprobs
- **Impact**: Users can gauge response quality at a glance

* Future Work

** Speculative Features
- Self-hosting experimentation platform (#43)
- Git worktree integration for experiments
- AI context resurrection (#49)

** Immediate TODOs
- Add asciinema recording (#46)
- Implement context management commands
- Add context size limits

* Session Metrics
- Duration: 4+ hours
- Features implemented: 6
- Issues created: 6
- Issues closed: 2
- Tests added: 6
- Commits: 3 major features

* Key Learnings
1. Small changes can have big impacts (conversation context)
2. Visual feedback improves UX significantly
3. Proper testing infrastructure pays dividends
4. FreeBSD requires special consideration (gmake vs make)
