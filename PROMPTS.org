#+AUTHOR: jwalsh + Claude
#+DATE: 2025-07-14
#+STARTUP: overview

* Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive documentation of every prompt, decision, and generation step used to create the Gemini REPL project. The project represents a unique case study in AI-assisted software development featuring formal methods integration, literate programming, and systematic prompt tracking.

** Key Statistics
- *45+ documented commits* with prompt histories in git notes
- *5 major setup .org files* generated and tangled
- *Complete formal specifications* (TLA+ and Alloy) before implementation
- *Self-hosting aspirations* with 3/10 current readiness
- *100% prompt traceability* from vision to implementation

* Genesis: The Initial Vision

** The Original Concept
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"i want to have a simple, simple console app in clojurescript that just makes calls to curl [Gemini API endpoint] but in a repl-ish format"
#+END_QUOTE

** Interface Design Decision
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"the exit and help commands should use a slash structure"
#+END_QUOTE

** Formal Methods Integration
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"i want to start by using formal methods to describe the interfaces or expectations of the system"
#+END_QUOTE

This trilogy of prompts established:
1. *Technology stack*: ClojureScript + Node.js
2. *User interface*: Slash command structure
3. *Development methodology*: Formal specifications first

* Literate Programming Phase: The .org File Generation

** SETUP.org - Foundation Generation
*** The Trigger Prompt
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"show a SETUP.org that just builds out those initial files"
#+END_QUOTE

*** Generated Content
- Project directory structure (=specs/=, =src/=, =tests/=, =docs/=)
- Formal specifications scaffolding (TLA+ and Alloy)
- Comprehensive requirements document
- Initial ClojureScript configuration

*** Methodology Established
This prompt established the literate programming pattern where:
1. Generate .org file with complete project structure
2. Tangle (extract) actual files from org blocks
3. Remove .org file after successful tangling
4. Document the generation process in git notes

** SPECS-SETUP.org - Formal Methods Tooling
*** Context Discovery Prompt
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"what tools do i need to use tla and alloy on freebsd"
#+END_QUOTE

*** Final Generation Prompt
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"create SPECS-TOOLING.org" (renamed to SPECS-SETUP.org)
#+END_QUOTE

*** Generated Infrastructure
- TLA+ installation for FreeBSD 14.3
- Alloy analyzer setup and configuration
- Verification pipeline integration
- Formal methods development workflow

** NODE-SETUP.org - Development Environment
*** Generation Context
Generated proactively after Node.js installation was detected in the environment.

*** Generated Content
- Complete ClojureScript development environment
- Shadow-CLJS configuration with hot reload
- REPL implementation with readline support
- Build and development tooling

** GITHUB-SETUP.org - CI/CD and Project Management
*** Minimal Trigger Prompt
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"show GITHUB-SETUP.org"
#+END_QUOTE

*** Generated Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions workflows for formal verification
- Issue templates for bugs, features, and RFCs
- Pull request templates with checklists
- Release automation workflows

** SHARED-SETUP.org - Project Management Structure
*** Specific Request Prompt
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"i want a SHARED-SETUP.org that creates directories for change-requests/ experiments/ and research/"
#+END_QUOTE

*** Generated Content
- Claude command system integration
- Project management directory structure
- Research and experimentation frameworks
- Adapted from defrecord/shared-infrastructure patterns

* Implementation Phase: Feature Development Prompts

** Core REPL Implementation
*** API Integration Prompts
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; Generated from prompts about Gemini API integration
(defn make-request [api-key prompt callback]
  ;; HTTPS integration with proper error handling
  ;; Token usage tracking and cost estimation
  ;; Conversation context management
  )
#+END_SRC

*** Command System Development
Slash commands implemented through iterative prompts:
- =/help= - Basic help system
- =/stats= - Session usage statistics  
- =/debug= - Toggle debug logging
- =/context= - Show conversation history
- =/clear= - Screen clearing functionality

** UI Enhancement Examples
*** Metadata Display Optimization
**** Issue Creation Prompt
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"add a gh issue for this trivial change: ## Bug Report: Metadata Display Too Verbose"
#+END_QUOTE

**** Implementation Prompt
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"implement that change" (referring to issue #44)
#+END_QUOTE

**** Result
Compact single-line metadata display: =[ðŸŸ¢ 245 tokens | $0.0001 | 0.8s]=

*** Conversation Context Feature
**** Request Prompt
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"ok, smallest possible change to implement that then run through some simple tests"
#+END_QUOTE

**** Implementation Details
- 18 lines of code for full conversation history
- =/context= command implementation
- Comprehensive test plan for multi-turn dialogues

* Formal Specifications: TLA+ and Alloy Integration

** TLA+ Specifications Generated
*** API Client Behavior (=api_client.tla=)
- State machine for API requests
- Error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting considerations

*** Command Processing (=commands.tla=)
- Slash command parsing and validation
- State transitions for REPL operations
- User input sanitization requirements

*** Interface Definitions (=interfaces.tla=)
- Module interactions and dependencies
- Data flow specifications
- Safety and liveness properties

** Alloy Models Created
*** Structural Validation (=gemini_api.alloy=)
- API request/response structure
- Data type constraints
- Relationship modeling

*** State Management (=state.alloy=)
- Session state invariants
- Conversation context constraints
- Memory management properties

* Development Methodology Documentation

** Systematic Session Tracking
Every development session documented with prompts in git notes:

*** Recent Session Example (2025-07-14)
#+BEGIN_SRC
Session prompts used:
- /mise-en-place: Comprehensive workspace cleanup and documentation review
- /security-review: Security analysis revealing API key logging issues 
- /self-analyze: Capability assessment showing 3/10 self-hosting readiness
- /research telemetry: OpenTelemetry integration investigation
- Issue lifecycle: Reopened #50, #18 â†’ applied documented fix â†’ verified â†’ closed
#+END_SRC

** Commit Convention Established
*** Format Requirements
- Conventional commits with detailed scope
- =--trailer= for co-author attribution
- No 'generated with' language in commit bodies
- Comprehensive change documentation

*** Example Commit Structure
#+BEGIN_SRC
fix(build): remove explicit shadow-cljs dependencies to eliminate warnings

- Remove org.clojure/clojurescript and core.async from shadow-cljs.edn
- Shadow-cljs manages these dependencies internally for compatibility
- Clean builds now show 0 warnings instead of dependency override messages

#+END_SRC

** Issue Tracking Methodology
*** Sociopathic Tracking Pattern
1. Create issue for every change, however trivial
2. Document implementation approach
3. Verify with testing pipeline
4. Close with detailed resolution notes
5. Reference in commit messages

*** Example Issue Lifecycle
#+BEGIN_SRC
gh issue create â†’ implement â†’ test â†’ commit â†’ close with notes
#+END_SRC

* Advanced Features and Experimental Development

** Self-Hosting Vision
*** Speculative Feature Prompt
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"add a speculative feature for the following but don't implement it: Excellent idea! Let's transform your REPL into a self-hosting experimentation platform using git worktrees"
#+END_QUOTE

*** Proposed Capabilities
- Git worktree integration for isolated experiments
- Self-modification via Gemini API with safety constraints
- Automatic research documentation generation
- Formal verification of self-modifications

** Capability Assessment (/self-analyze)
*** Current State Analysis
- *Self-hosting readiness*: 3/10
- *Tool calling*: Not yet implemented
- *File system access*: Limited to logging
- *Code modification*: Static compilation barriers

*** Growth Roadmap Identified
1. Tool calling framework (Priority 1)
2. File system interface (Priority 2)  
3. Self-modification engine (Priority 3)
4. Enhanced context management (Priority 4)
5. Security hardening (Priority 5)

** Research Integration (/research)
*** Telemetry Investigation Example
**** Discovery Context
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Existing OTEL infrastructure detected:
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<configured>
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=<configured>
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=<configured>
#+END_SRC

**** Research Outcomes
- OpenTelemetry Node.js integration patterns
- Metrics schema for REPL and LLM interactions
- Security considerations for telemetry data
- Infrastructure compatibility analysis

* Security and Quality Assurance

** Security Review Process (/security-review)
*** Comprehensive Analysis Conducted
1. *Authentication & Authorization*: Environment-based API key management
2. *Data Validation*: Input sanitization requirements identified
3. *Cryptography*: HTTPS-only API communication verified
4. *Common Vulnerabilities*: Path traversal and injection vectors assessed
5. *Environment Security*: File permissions and logging security

*** Critical Findings and Resolutions
**** False Alarm: API Key Exposure
- *Initial panic*: "CRITICAL! API KEY IN PLAINTEXT!"
- *Reality check*: Local development environment, .env properly gitignored
- *Lesson*: Security reviews must consider deployment context

**** Actual Issues Identified
- API keys logged in debug mode (sanitization needed)
- Log file path validation required
- Input sanitization for prompt injection prevention

** Quality Pipeline Established
*** Verification Sequence
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gmake lint    # ClojureScript and shell script linting
gmake test    # Unit tests and ClojureScript compilation
gmake verify  # TLA+ and Alloy specification verification
#+END_SRC

*** Pre-commit Validation
- Automated workspace checks
- TODO/FIXME detection
- Lint and test execution before commits

* Prompt Templates and Reusable Patterns

** Command Development Pattern
#+BEGIN_SRC
/[command-name] [specific-request]
â†’ Analyze current state
â†’ Implement minimal viable change
â†’ Test thoroughly
â†’ Document in git notes
â†’ Create/close related issues
#+END_SRC

** Issue Creation Template
#+BEGIN_SRC
gh issue create --title "[type]([scope]): [description]" 
                --label "[labels]" 
                --body "[detailed description with context]"
#+END_SRC

** Research Documentation Pattern
#+BEGIN_SRC
research/[topic]/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.org         # Overview and findings
â”œâ”€â”€ sources.org        # Bibliography and references
â”œâ”€â”€ notes/            # Detailed investigation notes
â””â”€â”€ findings.md       # Key insights and recommendations
#+END_SRC

** Formal Specification Workflow
1. Define system requirements in natural language
2. Create TLA+ specifications for behavior
3. Model structure and constraints in Alloy
4. Implement with specification-guided development
5. Verify implementation against formal models

* Lessons Learned and Best Practices

** Successful Patterns
*** Literate Programming Approach
- .org files enable comprehensive project generation
- Tangling provides clean separation of documentation and code
- Enables rapid prototyping with complete project structure

*** Formal Methods Integration
- Specifications before implementation prevents design errors
- TLA+ excellent for behavior modeling
- Alloy valuable for structural validation
- Automated verification catches regressions

*** Comprehensive Documentation
- Git notes preserve prompt history without cluttering commits
- Issue tracking provides complete change traceability
- Research documentation enables knowledge accumulation

** Methodological Innovations
*** Documentation-Driven Development
Every change follows the pattern:
1. Document intent (issue or prompt)
2. Implement minimal change
3. Verify through testing pipeline
4. Document results and learnings

*** AI-Assisted Development with Human Oversight
- AI provides implementation and suggestions
- Human maintains architectural vision and quality standards
- Formal specifications provide safety constraints
- Comprehensive testing validates all changes

** Challenges and Solutions
*** False Security Alarms
*Problem*: Over-aggressive security analysis in development context
*Solution*: Context-aware threat modeling and graduated response

*** Dependency Management
*Problem*: Shadow-CLJS dependency warnings
*Solution*: Let build tools manage core dependencies, document explicitly

*** Test Environment Limitations
*Problem*: Interactive tests failing in CI
*Solution*: Separate unit tests from interactive tests, skip timeouts in automation
